# Angular Calculator

Hello Readme readers.

Here's one of my very first project with angular 1.7

Basically this project is about recreating Windows Calculator with Angular. It may not be the best usage of it because i did it to learn Angular basics plus i added Bootstrap to perfect my skills with it.

# Instalation

If you want to try it yourself you need Node environments.
Clone this repository and use : "npm install -i" in your CLI then run live-server or others server options 

Cheers ! :)
